## Design Themes
In this project, we embraced a minimalist design approach with a light blue theme, predominantly utilizing the Material UI (MUI) component library. The font details used are as follows:
- **Font Family:** Raleway
- **Font Style:** Normal
- **Font Display:** Swap
- **Font Weight:** 400

## APIs Used
1. **USA Population API** - [DataUSA API](https://datausa.io/about/api/)
   - This API provides a range of data about the USA, notably focusing on population metrics for various years. We filtered the data to display information from recent years to offer users insights into population growth.

2. **Fake Store Data API** - [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products/)
   - The Fake Store API simulates an e-commerce store, offering details such as product names, descriptions, prices, ratings, etc. We utilized this API to populate product names and ratings in a bar graph, based on a 5.0 grading system.

3. **Regions and ISO Codes API** - [World Bank API](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/Z7?format=json)
   - This API provides information about different countries and regions, including ISO codes, latitudes and longitudes, capital cities, etc. We used this data to populate ISO codes, regions, and their respective capital cities.

## Project Components
- **Responsive React Application:** The application is built using React, ensuring responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Firebase Authentication:** Firebase Authentication is implemented to handle user authentication securely.
- **Custom Components:** Custom components such as a Music Player and Check List enhance the user experience.
- **Charts for Data Visualization:** We integrated charts to visualize data obtained from APIs, providing users with insightful graphical representations.
